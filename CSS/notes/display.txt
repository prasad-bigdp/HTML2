display property is used to make elements appear in different ways. Ususally there are two types of elements.
1. display:block ---> theses elements don't allow next elements to be side by side them.
2.display: inline ---> these elements allows next elements to adjust next to them.
Also inline elements cannot have height and width.
3. display:inline-block: incase we want elements  side by side and also height , width for them, we can give them property siplay inline block

4. display: table--> it arranges given elements as tables. so inside that every elemnt is considered as tr

5. display: none ---> it removes the element from DOM. its place is allocated to next element.
