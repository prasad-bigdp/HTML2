To understand Bootstrap, you need to understand following three things
1. layout
2. colors
3. media queries/ break points.

Colors: bootstrap offers by default eight colors
primary --  blue
secondary -- grey
success --- green
danger ---  red
info ---  skyblue
warning --- light gold
dark/black -- black
light/white -- white

2. layouts
Bootstrap follows grid layout with row and col as rows and columns.
Every contains 12 columns
you can specify any row as row classname and columns as col or col-values

3. breakpoints:
$grid-breakpoints: (
  xs: 0,
  sm: >=576px,
  md: >=768px,
  lg: >=992px,
  xl: >=1200px,
  xxl: >=1400px
);
col-lg-3 ---> that element will become col-3 from lg starting(992px)

you can use any bootstrap property
